##### Introduction

In this final exam, we delve into Computational Mathematics by participating in the House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition hosted on Kaggle.com. Through this exam, we aim to showcase our understanding of various mathematical concepts, statistical methods, and their application in real-world datasets. The exam spans across different branches of mathematics including probability theory, descriptive and inferential statistics, linear algebra, calculus-based probability and statistics, and modeling through regression analysis.

##### Installing required Libraries

suppressWarnings(library(data.table))
suppressWarnings(library(corrplot))
suppressWarnings(library(ggplot2))

```

##### Data

```{r}
houses <- fread("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/waheeb123/Data-605/main/Final%20Project/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/train.csv")

names(houses) <- tolower(gsub(" ", "_", names(houses)))

str(houses)
dim(houses)
kable(head(houses))


```

#### Missing Values and NA's

Handling missing values in the berginning to perform analysis smoothly later on. Creating a dataframe for columns of the dataframe houses to remove NA'swith required values(variables). Table out the values connecting each other to analyze NA's and remove or replace with required data. In our dataset garage condition, garage type, garage condition are interlinked, creating pairs to check this and handle the missing values.

```{r}
df_na<- data.frame(colSums(is.na(houses)))
names(df_na)<- c( "na")


kable(table(houses$poolqc,houses$poolarea, useNA = 'ifany'))

## 1,453 NA's with poolarea 0. assuming there is no pool, replace with "None"
houses$poolqc[is.na(houses$poolqc)]<- "None"

## Using similar technique for fire places
table(houses$fireplacequ,houses$fireplaces,useNA = 'ifany')
houses$fireplacequ[is.na(houses$fireplacequ)] <- "None"




## missing values for allcolumns related to garage, assuming no garage at all
#table(houses$garagetype,houses$garageyrblt,useNA = 'ifany')


houses$garagetype[is.na(houses$garagetype)] <- "None"
houses$garageyrblt[is.na(houses$garageyrblt)] <- ""
houses$garagecond[is.na(houses$garagecond)] <- "None"
houses$garagefinish[is.na(houses$garagefinish)] <- "None"
houses$garagequal[is.na(houses$garagequal)] <- "None"



## another category
table(is.na(houses$masvnrarea),is.na(houses$masvnrtype))
houses$masvnrtype[is.na(houses$masvnrtype)] <- "None"
houses$masvnrarea[is.na(houses$masvnrarea)] <- 0


##for basement

table(houses$bsmtfintype1,houses$bsmtfintype2, useNA = 'ifany')
houses$bsmtfintype1[is.na(houses$bsmtfintype1)] <- "None"
houses$bsmtfintype2[is.na(houses$bsmtfintype2)] <- "None"

table(houses$bsmtqual,houses$bsmtcond, useNA = 'ifany')
houses$bsmtqual[is.na(houses$bsmtqual)] <- "None"
houses$bsmtcond[is.na(houses$bsmtcond)] <- "None"
houses$bsmtexposure[is.na(houses$bsmtexposure)] <- "None"  
## we can replace basement exposure  with "No" as it is included in the values, we assume it is different than ##having a basement with no exposure or no basement at all



### misc. columns
houses$miscfeature[is.na(houses$miscfeature)] <- "None"
houses$fence[is.na(houses$fence)] <- "None"
houses$alley[is.na(houses$alley)] <- "None"
houses$lotfrontage[is.na(houses$lotfrontage)] <- 0
houses$electrical[is.na(houses$electrical)] <- "None"




colSums(is.na(houses))

## no misiing values, we can move forward with the analysis.
```

Another required check is to find unique levels of categorical variables.Categories are incorrectly entered as lower case or first letter is capitalized. e.g. column misc feature has the categoies

"None" "Shed" "Gar2" "Othr" "TenC". We can perform a check at the variables if the data is correct. "Othr" "othr" might corresponds to same category. Random check was performed on few categorical variables. Based on the variables required for analysis, this can be performed on them.

```{r}

## performing a random check at cat. variables.

unique(houses$extercond)

unique(houses$extercond)

unique(houses$miscval)


unique(houses$street)
```

##### Selecting Variables for Probability

Pick one of the quanititative independent variables from the training data set (train.csv) , and define that variable as X. Make sure this variable is skewed to the right! Pick the dependent variable and define it as Y.

The variable to be selected for the prediction is lot area.Variable X will be the lot area and vriable Y is described as the sale price.

Plotting the variables.

```{r}
X<- hist (houses$lotfrontage)
Y<- hist (houses$saleprice)
```

##### Probability

Calculate as a minimum the below probabilities a through c. Assume the small letter "x" is estimated as the 3d quartile of the X variable, and the small letter "y" is estimated as the 2d quartile of the Y variable. Interpret the meaning of all probabilities. In addition, make a table of counts as shown below.

```{r}

# Extract data
X <- houses$lotfrontage
Y <- houses$saleprice

# Compute quartiles
## Third quartile of X
x <- quantile(X, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)

## Second quartile of Y
y <- quantile(Y, 0.50, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Interpretation of probabilities
# a. P(X>x | Y>y)
prob_a <- sum(X > x & Y > y) / sum(Y > y)

# b. P(X>x, Y>y)
prob_b <- sum(X > x & Y > y) / length(X) # Assuming total number of observations for X and Y are the same

# c. P(X<x | Y>y)
prob_c <- sum(X < x & Y > y) / sum(Y > y)

# Create a table of counts
table_X <- cut(X, breaks = c(-Inf, x, Inf), labels = c("<=3d quartile", ">3d quartile"))
table_Y <- cut(Y, breaks = c(-Inf, y, Inf), labels = c("<=2d quartile", ">2d quartile"))
table_counts <- table(table_X, table_Y)

# Add totals to the table
table_counts_with_totals <- addmargins(table_counts)

# Display results
print("Probability a:")
print(kable(prob_a))
print("Probability b:")
print(kable(prob_b))
print("Probability c:")
print(kable(prob_c))
print("Table of counts:")
print(kable(table_counts_with_totals))


```

**a. P(X\>x \| Y\>y)**

Probability of lot frontage exceeding x given sale price exceeds y, calculated as instances where X is in top quartile and Y is in second highest quartile divided by total Y instances in that quartile.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**b. P(X\>x, Y\>y)**

The probability indicates the likelihood of both lot frontage (X) and sale price (Y) exceeding their respective quartile values (x) and (y). It's computed by dividing the count of observations where both X and Y exceed their quartile values (243) by the total count of observations (1460).

**c. P(X\<x \| Y\>y)**

The probability signifies the chance that the lot frontage (X) is below the third quartile value (x) given that the sale price (Y) exceeds the second quartile value (y). It's computed by dividing the count of observations where X falls into the lower or equal to the third quartile category and Y falls into the higher than the second quartile category (485) by the total count of observations where Y falls into the higher than the second quartile category (728).

**Does splitting the training data in this fashion make them independent? Let A be the new variable counting those observations above the 3d quartile for X, and let B be the new variable counting those observations above the 2d quartile for Y. Does P(A\|B)=P(A)P(B)? Check mathematically, and then evaluate by running a Chi Square test for association.**

```{r}
# Calculate total count of observations
total_count <- nrow(houses)

# Calculate counts for A (observations above the third quartile for X) and B (observations above the second quartile for Y)
count_A <- sum(X > x)  # Count of observations above the third quartile for X
count_B <- sum(Y > y)  # Count of observations above the second quartile for Y

# Calculate probabilities
prob_A <- count_A / total_count
prob_B <- count_B / total_count

# Extract counts for A and B
table_A <- table_X == ">3d quartile"
table_B <- table_Y == ">2d quartile"

# Calculate count of observations in A and B
count_A_and_B <- sum(table_A & table_B)

# Calculate probability of A intersection B
prob_A_and_B <- count_A_and_B / total_count

# Calculate conditional probability P(A|B)
prob_A_given_B <- prob_A_and_B / prob_B

# Check if P(A|B) = P(A) * P(B)
is_independent <- prob_A_given_B == (prob_A * prob_B)

# Chi-square test for association
chisq_test <- chisq.test(table_counts)

```

```{r}
# Display results
cat("Probability of observations above the third quartile for X (A):", prob_A, "\n")
cat("Probability of observations above the second quartile for Y (B):", prob_B, "\n")
cat("Probability of observations in both A and B (A âˆ© B):", prob_A_and_B, "\n")
cat("Conditional probability P(A|B):", prob_A_given_B, "\n")
cat("Is A independent of B (P(A|B) = P(A) * P(B)):", is_independent, "\n\n")

# Chi-square test result
cat("Chi-square test for association:\n")
print(chisq_test)

```

The Chi-square test indicates a significant association between the variables A and B, rejecting the hypothesis of independence.

##### Descriptive and Inferential Statistics.

Provide univariate descriptive statistics and appropriate plots for the training data set. Provide a scatterplot of X and Y. Provide a 95% CI for the difference in the mean of the variables. Derive a correlation matrix for two of the quantitative variables you selected. Test the hypothesis that the correlation between these variables is 0 and provide a 99% confidence interval. Discuss the meaning of your analysis.

```{r}
# Univariate Descriptive Statistics
summary(houses)

# Plotting histograms for all quantitative variables
par(mfrow = c(2, 2)) # Setting up the layout for multiple plots
hist(houses$lotfrontage, main = "Histogram of Lot Frontage", xlab = "Lot Frontage")
hist(houses$saleprice, main = "Histogram of Sale Price", xlab = "Sale Price")
hist(houses$lotarea, main = "Histogram of Lot Area", xlab = "Lot Area")
hist(houses$overallqual, main = "Histogram of Overall Quality", xlab = "Overall Quality")

# Scatterplot of X (lotfrontage) and Y (saleprice)
plot(houses$lotfrontage, houses$saleprice, xlab = "Lot Frontage", ylab = "Sale Price", main = "Scatterplot of Lot Frontage vs. Sale Price")

# 95% Confidence Interval for the Difference in Means
t.test(houses$lotfrontage, houses$saleprice, conf.level = 0.95)

# Correlation Matrix
correlation_matrix <- cor(houses[, c("lotfrontage", "saleprice")])

# Test for correlation
correlation_test <- cor.test(houses$lotfrontage, houses$saleprice)

# Confidence Interval for Correlation
correlation_ci <- cor.test(houses$lotfrontage, houses$saleprice, conf.level = 0.99)

# Display results
print("Correlation Matrix:")
print(correlation_matrix)

print("Test for Correlation:")
print(correlation_test)

print("Confidence Interval for Correlation:")
print(correlation_ci)

```

95% CI for Difference in Means: Difference in means between Lot Frontage and Sale Price estimated between -\$184,941.9 and -\$176,785.2. Correlation: Weak positive correlation (r = 0.21) between Lot Frontage and Sale Price, statistically significant (p \< 0.05).

##### Linear Algebra and Correlation.

Invert your correlation matrix. (This is known as the precision matrix and contains variance inflation factors on the diagonal.) Multiply the correlation matrix by the precision matrix, and then multiply the precision matrix by the correlation matrix. Conduct principle components analysis (research this!) and interpret. Discuss.

```{r}
# Invert the correlation matrix (calculate the precision matrix)
precision_matrix <- solve(correlation_matrix)

# Multiply the correlation matrix by the precision matrix
correlation_precision <- correlation_matrix %*% precision_matrix

# Multiply the precision matrix by the correlation matrix
precision_correlation <- precision_matrix %*% correlation_matrix

# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
pca_result <- prcomp(houses[, c("lotfrontage", "saleprice")], scale. = TRUE)

# Summary of PCA
summary(pca_result)

```

The PCA results show that the first principal component (PC1) explains 60.48% of the total variance, while the second principal component (PC2) explains 39.52%. Together, these two components capture all the variance in the dataset, with PC1 being more influential in explaining the variability compared to PC2.

##### Calculus-Based Probability & Statistics.

Many times, it makes sense to fit a closed form distribution to data. For your variable that is skewed to the right, shift it so that the minimum value is above zero. Then load the MASS package and run fitdistr to fit an exponential probability density function. (See <https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/MASS/html/fitdistr.html> ). Find the optimal value of l for this distribution, and then take 1000 samples from this exponential distribution using this value (e.g., rexp(1000, Î»)). Plot a histogram and compare it with a histogram of your original variable. Using the exponential pdf, find the 5th and 95th percentiles using the cumulative distribution function (CDF). Also generate a 95% confidence interval from the empirical data, assuming normality. Finally, provide the empirical 5th percentile and 95th percentile of the data. Discuss.

```{r}
# Shift the data so that the minimum value is above zero
shifted_data <- houses$lotarea - min(houses$lotarea) + 1

# Load the MASS package
library(MASS)

# Fit exponential distribution using fitdistr
fit_exponential <- fitdistr(shifted_data, "exponential")

# Get the optimal value of lambda
optimal_lambda <- fit_exponential$estimate

# Generate 1000 samples from the exponential distribution
samples <- rexp(1000, rate = optimal_lambda)

```

```{r}
# Summary of the fitted exponential distribution
print("Summary of the fitted exponential distribution:")
print(fit_exponential)

# Print the optimal value of lambda
cat("Optimal value of lambda:", optimal_lambda, "\n")

# Summary statistics of the generated samples
summary(samples)

# Visualize the generated samples
hist(samples, main = "Histogram of Generated Samples from Exponential Distribution", xlab = "Sample Value", ylab = "Frequency")

```

```{r}
# Calculate the 5th and 95th percentiles using the CDF of the fitted exponential distribution
percentile_5 <- qexp(0.05, rate = optimal_lambda)
percentile_95 <- qexp(0.95, rate = optimal_lambda)

# Generate a 95% confidence interval from the empirical data assuming normality
mean_empirical <- mean(shifted_data)
sd_empirical <- sd(shifted_data)
n <- length(shifted_data)
margin_of_error <- qt(0.975, df = n-1) * sd_empirical / sqrt(n)
confidence_interval <- c(mean_empirical - margin_of_error, mean_empirical + margin_of_error)

# Provide the empirical 5th and 95th percentiles of the data
empirical_percentile_5 <- quantile(shifted_data, 0.05)
empirical_percentile_95 <- quantile(shifted_data, 0.95)

# Print the results
cat("5th Percentile using CDF:", percentile_5, "\n")
cat("95th Percentile using CDF:", percentile_95, "\n")
cat("95% Confidence Interval from Empirical Data (Normality Assumption):", confidence_interval, "\n")
cat("Empirical 5th Percentile:", empirical_percentile_5, "\n")
cat("Empirical 95th Percentile:", empirical_percentile_95, "\n")

```

These values offer a compact overview of the distribution characteristics and provide key insights into the dataset's variability and central tendency.

##### Modeling.

Build some type of regression model and submit your model to the competition board. Provide your complete model summary and results with analysis. Report your Kaggle.com user name and score.

**Simple linear regression**

```{r}
# Simple linear regression model of SalePrice by GrLivArea, for later comparison to our multi-linear regression model
train.lm <- lm(Y ~ X, data=houses)

# Get summary of our model
summary(train.lm)
```

```{r}
# Residuals scatterplot
plot(train.lm$fitted.values, train.lm$residuals, xlab="Fitted Values", ylab="Residuals")
abline(h=0, col="skyblue")
```

```{r}
# Residuals Histogram
hist(train.lm$residuals, main="Simple Linear Residuals Histogram")
```

```{r}
# QQ Plot
qqnorm(train.lm$residuals)
qqline(train.lm$residuals)
```

```{r}
# Plot
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(train.lm)
```

**Multiple Linear Regression**

```{r}
# Multiple regression model
train.lm2 <- lm(saleprice ~ lotfrontage + lotarea, data = houses)

# Check summary of our multiple-regression model
summary(train.lm2)

```

The multiple R-squared value of 0.1035 indicates that approximately 10.35% of the variability in sale prices can be explained by the predictors lotfrontage and lotarea.This model is significantly more accurate than a single linear regression model which accounted for only 50% of the variance.

Now, we must predict SalePrice in test_data using our model


```{r}
# Read test.csv
test_data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/waheeb123/Data-605/main/Final%20Project/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/test_data")

# Summary
summary(test_data)

```

```{r}
# Check for nulls/missing data
anyNA(test_data)
```

```{r}
# How many missing values?
sum(is.na(test_data))
```

```{r,error = FALSE}
# 7000 missing values


# Missing values from each column
Missing_values2 <- colSums(is.na(test_data))
Missing_values2[Missing_values2>0]
```


```{r}
# Let's replace the missing numeric records with the average value of each column
for(i in 1:ncol(test_data)){
  test_data[is.na(test_data[ ,i]), i] <- mean(test_data[ ,i], na.rm = TRUE)
}


# Now replace the missing values in the categorical variables (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36377813/impute-most-frequent-categorical-value-in-all-columns-in-data-frame)
i2 <- !sapply(test_data, is.numeric)

# Most common value
Mode <- function(x) { 
      ux <- sort(unique(x))
      ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x, ux)))] 
}

# Replace the NAs in character columns with the most freq
test_data[i2] <- lapply(test_data[i2], function(x)
              replace(x, is.na(x), Mode(x[!is.na(x)])))

# Check to see if any values are missing/NA
sum(is.na(test_data)) 
```


```{r}
# Create new dataframe of ID's and predicted SalePrice for Kaggle Submission
Kaggle <- test_data[, c('Id', 'SalePrice')]

# Export new dataframe to csv
write.csv(Kaggle, "605final.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```
