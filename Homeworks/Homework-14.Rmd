## Introduction
The Taylor Series expansion is a powerful mathematical tool that allows us to approximate complex functions as infinite series of polynomials. By representing a function as a sum of its derivatives evaluated at a particular point, Taylor Series provide a way to understand the behavior of functions in the vicinity of that point. In this research, we delve into the Taylor Series expansions of four fundamental functions

## Methodology
We utilized the R programming language and relevant packages such as calculus and Deriv to compute the Taylor Series expansions of the selected functions. The Taylor Series expansion formula was employed, considering the function's derivatives evaluated at specific points,we’ll work out some Taylor Series expansions of popular functions.

1. $f(x) = (1−x)$
2. $f(x) = e^x$  
3. $f(x) = ln(1 + x)$
4. $f(x) = x^{(1/2)}$

For each function, only consider its valid ranges as indicated in the notes when you are computing the Taylor Series expansion. Please submit your assignment as an R-Markdown document.

## The Solution

For each function, I'll start work out the expansion using the base formula for Taylor Series.

$$f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(c)}{n!} (x-c)^n$$
I'll work out the first four terms, centered on zero.

$$f(x) = f(c) + f'(c)(x-c) + \frac{f''(c)}{2!}(x-c)^2 + \frac{f'''(c)}{3!}(x-c)^3$$

#### Function 1

$$f(x) = (1−x)$$

This first function is a bit unique, in that the function is already linear. So, a Taylor Series expansion does not serve a functional purpose, in that there is no need to approximate!

Still, we can work through the expansion. The first derivative of $f(x) = (1−x)$ with respect to $x$ is simply -1. That means that all further derivatives are simply zero. So, our Taylor Series looks as follows.

$$f(x) = 1-0 + -1(x-c) + \frac{0}{2!}(x-c)^2 + \frac{0}{3!}(x-c)^3 + ...$$

Beyond the first two terms, all are zero, so we just have the following.

$$f(x) = 1 + -1(x-c)$$

Which we can simplify to $1-x+c$. If we center this on $c=0$, then we are left with $1-x$, which is our original function. It makes sense that the Taylor Series of a linear function $f(x)$ is simply $f(x)$. Taylor Series are a linear approximation of non-linear functions. So if we apply the approach to an already linear function, we get an exact match.

Let's check our result against the `taylor` function from the  `calculus` package.

```{r}
f1_taylor <- taylor('1-x', var = 'x', order = 4)
print(f1_taylor$f)
```

It's the same!

#### Function 2

$$f(x) = e^x$$ 

Figure 8.8.1 in the text gives us the simplified expansion for $e^x$ as follows.

$$ 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + ...$$

Let's work to this same spot using the base Taylor Series formula. First, we need to evaluate $f(x)$ at $c=0$ for the first term, and $e^0$ is just 1.

Second, we need the first, second and third derivatives of $e^x$. For this function, however, the answer is simple: it's always $e^x$. In fact, that is the part of what defines $e^x$: it represents the constant that, when used as a base in an exponential function, has a derivative that is proportional to itself by a factor of 1. In other words, $e^x$ is the unique function that equals its own derivative. So, for all terms in our Taylor Series, the function that we will evaluate is just $e^x$.

Let's plug these values in to our Taylor Series formula with $c=0$.


$$f(x) = f(c) + f'(c)(x-c) + \frac{f''(c)}{2!}(x-c)^2 + \frac{f'''(c)}{3!}(x-c)^3$$
$$f(x) = 1 + e^0 (x-0) + \frac{e^0}{2!}(x-0)^2 + \frac{e^0}{3!}(x-0)^3$$
$$f(x) = 1 + 1 (x) + \frac{1}{2!}(x)^2 + \frac{1}{3!}(x)^3$$
$$ 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} $$

With that, we've landed back at what we had in the text. Let's run a final check with `calculus`.

```{r}
f2_taylor <- taylor('exp(x)', 'x', order = 4)
print(f2_taylor$f)
```

It appears to match, but let's check these coefficients. 

```{r}
print(1/factorial(2))
print(1/factorial(3))
print(1/factorial(4))
```

Looks great!

#### Function 3

$$f(x) = ln(1 + x)$$ 

Figure 8.8.1 gives us the expansion for $ln(x)$ as follows:

$$(x-1) - \frac{(x-1)^2}{2} + \frac{(x-1)^3}{3} - ...$$

I would presume $ln(1+x)$ follows a similar pattern, but let's work it out.

First, we find that $f(0) = ln(1) = 0$, so our first term drops off. Next, we find derivatives.

```{r}
f <- function(x) log(1+x)
df <- Deriv(f)
df2 <- Deriv(df)
df3 <- Deriv(df2)
df4 <- Deriv(df3)

print(df)
print(df2)
print(df3)
print(df4)

print(df(0))
print(df2(0))
print(df3(0))
print(df4(0))
```

So, our coefficients are 1, -1, 2 and -6 for our second, third, fourth and fifth terms. Let's plug these in.

$$f(x) = f(c) + f'(c)(x-c) + \frac{f''(c)}{2!}(x-c)^2 + \frac{f'''(c)}{3!}(x-c)^3 + \frac{f''''(c)}{4!}(x-c)^4$$
$$f(x) = 0 + 1(x-0) + \frac{-1}{2!}(x-0)^2 + \frac{2}{3!}(x-0)^3 + \frac{-6}{4!}(x-0)^4$$
$$f(x) = 0 + 1(x) + \frac{-1}{2!}(x)^2 + \frac{2}{3!}(x)^3 + \frac{-6}{4!}(x)^4$$
$$f(x) = 0 + x - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{2x^3}{3!} - \frac{6x^4}{4!}$$

```{r}
f3_taylor <- taylor('log(1+x)', 'x', order = 4)
print(f3_taylor$f)
```

Looks good. We already confirmed that 1/2! equals 0.5 (duh), but I'll double check that those others.

```{r}
2/factorial(3)
6/factorial(4)
```

We're good :)

Bringing it back to the Series for $ln(x)$, we see a similar positive-negative pattern and overall structure. But it seems that we've gotten rid of the $(x-1)$ format and introduced some other coefficients.

#### Function 4

$$f(x) = x^{(1/2)}$$

For this function, we have $x$ alone in the base, so centering on zero will result in the zeroing out of all terms. So, we'll center this Series on $c=1$.

We can evaluate $f(1)$ as $1^{1/2} = 1$. Next, we can find the first three derivatives by applying the power rule.

$$f'(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^{-1/2}$$
$$f''(x) = -\frac{1}{4}x^{-3/2}$$
$$f'''(x) = \frac{3}{8}x^{-5/2}$$

We can see we've got some strange exponents to deal with. Luckly, we are centering on 1, and 1 to any power is just 1, which should clean things up.

Let's try and plug these in with $c=1$.

$$f(x) = f(c) + f'(c)(x-c) + \frac{f''(c)}{2!}(x-c)^2 + \frac{f'''(c)}{3!}(x-c)^3$$
$$f(x) = 1 + \frac{1}{2}1^{-1/2}(x-1) + \frac{-\frac{1}{4}1^{-3/2}}{2!}(x-1)^2 + \frac{\frac{3}{8}1^{-5/2}}{3!}(x-1)^3$$
$$f(x) = 1 + \frac{1}{2}1(x-1) + \frac{-\frac{1}{4}1}{2!}(x-1)^2 + \frac{\frac{3}{8}1}{3!}(x-1)^3$$
$$f(x) = 1 + \frac{1}{2}(x-1) - \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{2!}(x-1)^2 + \frac{\frac{3}{8}}{3!}(x-1)^3$$

We can get some rough decimals to try and clean this up a bit.

```{r}
(1/4)/factorial(2)
(3/8)/factorial(3)
```

$$f(x) = 1 + 0.5(x-1) - 0.125(x-1)^2 + 0.0625(x-1)^3$$

Finally, let's check it. I don't believe we can center on any other value except 0 in the `taylor` function in `calculus`. Instead, we'll just check the coefficients using `pracma`.

```{r}
f <- function(x) x^(1/2)
pracma::taylor(f, x0 = 1, n = 3)
```

## Conclusion

Through this research, we have explored the Taylor Series expansions of fundamental functions and observed their behavior within specified ranges. While most expansions align with expected results, Function 4 presents a minor discrepancy that requires additional scrutiny. Further investigation into the Taylor Series expansions of various functions can deepen our understanding of their mathematical properties and applications.
